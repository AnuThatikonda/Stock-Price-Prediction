## Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview:

This project involves predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting. 
The model is trained on historical stock price data to provide accurate predictions of future prices, which can be used for financial analysis and decision-making.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.7+
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
TensorFlow
Keras
scikit-learn

## How It Works:

Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the historical stock data by handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting it into training and test datasets.
Feature Engineering: Generate features that help the model learn and predict more effectively.
Model Building: Implement an LSTM-based model using TensorFlow and Keras, train it on the preprocessed data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance on the test dataset and visualize the results using various metrics.
Visualization: Plot the actual vs. predicted stock prices to analyze the model’s performance.
